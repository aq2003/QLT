# QL - A Language for Managing Processes

## 1. Basic Designations
<small letters> - process instance<br/>
Example: $a_0, a_1, a_3, ... a_n$ means processes $a_0, a_1, a_3, ... a_n$<br/>

<capital letters> - data objects<br/>
Example: $A_0, A_1, A_3, ... A_n$ means processes $A_0, A_1, A_3, ... A_n$<br/>

symbols:<br/>
- `;` - processes sequence by time
- `..` - repeated processes sequence by time
- `||` - alternative concurrency
- `&&` - cooperative concurrency
- `<<` - cause-and-effect relationship

## 2. What is a process
Let's follow a process description <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process">given here.</a><br/>
processes can be combined in various ways.
